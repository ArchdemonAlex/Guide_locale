  \ tips (solo):\nLet's start with weapons, there are weapons that will be effective\
  \ against the rhino, and there are weapons that will be little or no effective at\
  \ all, and neutral\n\n‚úÖ Effective: knife, sawblade, saber, pole, brass knuckles,\

  \ I recommend holding it until the rhino rage; the same goes for parrying a saber,\
  \ if you parry, chances are you'll still get stunned and lose a move.\nIf you have\
  \ an alchemist, you can roll and use rabies serum on yourself.\n\nNow the rhino\

  That leaves us with one ‚Äòfree‚Äô ability, I recommend it:

  Walkthrough tips (solo):

  ‚ñ´Ô∏è Use the alchemist (if available) and darkness on yourself (and pray very hard

  The point is that thanks to the darkness, your attacks will get +1 damage, and abilities
  that have a cooldown will be accelerated (including roll and dash).


  Now you just have to slowly kill Alastor by countering his vanshots correctly.


  ‚ö†Ô∏è Try not to summon the Necromancer''s staff ‚Äòdead man''s rise‚Äô before his attack,
  firstly, the darkness does not affect the recharge, secondly, the Electric Beam
  deals damage like a grenade (i.e. attacking all targets), this also applies to corpses,
