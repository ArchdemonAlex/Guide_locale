  The Vampire has an initial health of 6 xp

  ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️|6 lives. Max: 6


  The Vampire is able to launch a bat (located in addition).

  Launching the bat does not waste a move, i.e. it is an additional action (like adrenaline
  for example), so you should use the bat first and then walk.

  Launching the mouse does not waste energy and can be launched at 0 energy.

  Mouse does 3-3 damage on the next turn after launching and gets on a roll (even
  ninjis)

  Mouse has a 3 turn cooldown (launched on the 1st - will roll on the 4th)


  His weapons are Vampire Fangs.
