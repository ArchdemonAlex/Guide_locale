  "spellcaster.glossary": "Spellcaster is a pretty diverse skill. You have an extensive set of abilities in your arsenal, the use of which will help you in almost all game situations.\n\nThere are 21 abilities and 13 elements in total (but you will only get 9 of them per turn). Each spell consists of three elements, and among them can be repeated. That is, a spell does not have to contain 3 different elements, it can consist of two elements of one type and a third element of another type. For example: \uD83E\uDE78\uD83E\uDE78\uD83C\uDF2B or \uD83E\uDE78\uD83E\uDE78\uD83E\uDE78\uD83E\uDE78. Now, the order of the elements is no longer important.\n\uD83C\uDF2B\uD83E\uDE78\uD83C\uDF2B\uD83E\uDE78 and \uD83E\uDE78\uD83C\uDF2B\uD83E\uDE78 are the same for the world of magic. Also, after each successful spell, the caster requires rest depending on the strength of the ability used.\nP.S.
