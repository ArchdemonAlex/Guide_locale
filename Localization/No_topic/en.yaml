  \ Maximum: 4 is your xp, if you have 0 lives, you lose. Your goal is to reduce your\
  \ opponent's lives before they reduce yours.\n\n⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️|5 energy. Maximum: 5\
  \ is your energy that is spent on attacking - on average, melee uses 2 energy per\
  \ turn, ranged 3. There are weapons exceptions to the rules.\n\n\U0001F3AF|Probability\
  \ to hit - 97% - the probability of hitting the enemy depends on the amount of current\
  \ energy and accuracy of the weapon and additional abilities!\n\nThere is also a\
  \ parameter invisible to the player - Damage Limit\nDamage limit, aka damage threshold.\
  \ If you deal damage that exceeds the player's damage limit, the player will lose\
  \ 2 xp per turn!\n\nSo now let's get to the mechanics of battles, in front of you\
  \ will be a few buttons -\nAttack. Reload/Rest. Roll. Info. Advanced. Approach.\
  \ Skip move.\n\nAttack - as the name implies, you need to attack the opponent, expends\
  \ energy. If there is no energy - the chance to hit is 0%, you can't damage the\
  \ enemy. If at the very beginning of the battle when you press the attack button,\
  \ you have no opponent - you need to approach and press the button of the same name.\
  \ \n\nRecharge/Rest - click if you are out of or low on energy, restores energy\
  \ completely.\n|0 energy. Maximum: 5\n\U0001F3AF| 0% chance of hitting.\n\nChosen:\
  \ recharge.\n\n⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️|5 energy. Maximum: 5\n\U0001F3AF|Hit probability - 97%]\n\
  \nRoll - As the name suggests, this button is needed to dodge enemy attacks - does\
  \ not guarantee 100% dodge (as it lowers enemy accuracy by 5).\n\nInfo - Needed\
  \ to get rid of fear effect, otherwise useless.\n\nExtras - There will be \U0001F4A3\
  \ Items and some abilities that require activation.\n\nApproach - needed if you\
  \ have a melee weapon (including fists), not needed if you have a ranged weapon.\n\
  \nSkip move - needed to skip a move, as well as this button is needed to extinguish\
  \ from fire."
